In this project, I developed an intelligent agent for a maze-based treasure hunt game using deep Q-learning. My main contribution was implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm in the qtrain function, which involved designing the agentâ€™s learning process, balancing exploration and exploitation, and refining the model based on performance. This project allowed me to apply machine learning principles to create a functional solution for pathfinding in a dynamic environment.

Reflecting on this work, it highlights the role of computer scientists in solving complex problems by designing and implementing algorithms that drive innovation. The problem-solving approach involves understanding the problem, designing and coding solutions, and iterating based on performance evaluations. Ethical responsibilities include ensuring user privacy, fairness, and transparency in technology use. In this project, I adhered to these principles by creating a responsible and effective agent, considering the broader implications of my work in AI and machine learning.
